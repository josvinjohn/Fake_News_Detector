# Fake_News_Detector
- Built a BERT based model with PyTorch and Keras preprocessing libraries to predict the probability that a given news article is fake.
- Deployed the model to an application server built with Flask to serve requests from frontend applications. 
- Used available APIs to suggest alternative sources of information when articles with high probabilities of being fake get accessed.
